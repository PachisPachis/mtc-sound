# mtc-sound
Direct control of Sound Processor IC for Microntek based Car Head Units
This a fork from original mtc-sound from 7floor. After doing the mod in my MTCD PX5 unit I noticed some bugs because of updates in the factory firmware/software.
Currently I fixed the following bugs present in my unit:

1-Volume attenuation when reverse gear not working (fixed)
2-GPS mixing with FM radio not working (fixed, some glitches now and then)
3-Error/Warning upon startup (fixed, big thanks to DSA8310 who provided me the code)

I will upload the pending commits the next days.
